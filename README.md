#My Process : 

I created basic skeletal structure of our web page after observing the design. I attached appropriate tags to the text as per my judgment to make it look as
close to design as possible. 
After that, I created div elemets to properly design the page. 
I added design layout using external css file.

#What I learned : 

I learned how to use box-shadow property. I also learned how to make a page responsive. It has improved my web page designing skills. 

#continued developement : 
I would like to make this page as better as possible. I want to write a cleaner and more readable code. I would appreciate help in this regard.

#Useful Resources : 
The only resource I used for this is ChatGPT. I am quite reluctant to use it because I don't just want to copy paste the code, But I think its fine if I use
it just to understand concepts and find bugs/errors. Other methods just take a lot of valuable time.
